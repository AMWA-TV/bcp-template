## About BCP-TEMPLATE



### What does it do?

- It provides a template for AMWA NMOS Interface Specifcations.

### Why does it matter?

- It helps us test our continuous integration.

### How does it work?

- It contains examples of [documentation](docs/), [APIs](APIs/), [schemas](APIs/schemas/), and [examples](examples/)
- It provides a style guide and other advice for specification authors
  - This includes how to configure the repo for automatic linting and rendering to `specs.amwa.tv`
- Select `AMWA-TV/bcp-template` as the template when creating the new repo.

BCP-TEMPLATE has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.amwa.tv/nmos-overview) initiative.
See [here](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The [NMOS Testing Tool](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos-testing) creates a simple web service for testing implementations of all NMOS APIs.

The links to documentation, API and examples below, and for SPEC links in the page menu bar are for this release or branch: **branches/v1.0-dev**. Links to [other published releases](releases/) and [other live branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or in the VERSIONS menu.

## Documentation for branch v1.0-dev

<!-- 

Use this file to specify an ordered and leveled markdown list the documents that need to be rendered
This list will be rendered at "https://specs.amwa.tv/<spec>/<version>/docs/"

- Use a "-" bullet character for each document, indented as you want it to appear in the list, followed by a space
- Follow that with the name to display, in square brackets
- Follow that immediately by then the document filename, in round parentheses
  - Include the ".md"
  - Don't include the "docs/"
  - Escape any spaces with "%20" (this is needed so links work on github.com)
- Don't use document numbers (this was previous practice for NMOS docs)
- Other text and headings can be included.  Level-3 headings ("###") work best.
- The display name and filename don't need to match (see IS-04 for examples of this).
- All documents that need rendering must be listed.

See https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-template/docs/README.md for an example of the syntax
